# NFL Analysis## Skills: Linear Regression, R, Sports analysisThe task is to build a linear regression model with the most relevant independent variables relating to number of games won. To build the regression model we choose the most relevant independent variables. For this purpose we build a linear regression model with all the independent variables. Once we have the summary we can go ahead and eliminate the least significant variables. For this purpose we check the variables which are not significant and the p values greater than  0.05 and eliminate them. ![NFL_1](https://github.com/vchandrasekaran/NFL-Analysis/blob/master/Images/NFL_1.png)The steps of elimination and selecting the most significant variables are given below. The p value of X5 is greater than 0.05 and we will be removing it from our model. ![NFL_2](https://github.com/vchandrasekaran/NFL-Analysis/blob/master/Images/NFL_2.png)The p value of X1 is greater than 0.05 and we will be removing it from our model.![NFL_3](https://github.com/vchandrasekaran/NFL-Analysis/blob/master/Images/NFL_3.png)The p value of X6 is greater than 0.05 and we will be removing it from our model.![NFL_4](https://github.com/vchandrasekaran/NFL-Analysis/blob/master/Images/NFL_4.png)
