For this purpose we build a linear regression model with all the independent variables. Once we have the summary we can go ahead and eliminate the least significant variables. For this purpose we check the variables which are not significant and the p values greater than  0.05 and eliminate them. ![NFL_1](https://github.com/vchandrasekaran/NFL-Analysis/blob/master/Images/NFL_1.png)The steps of elimination and selecting the most significant variables are given below. The p value of X5 is greater than 0.05 and we will be removing it from our model. ![NFL_2](https://github.com/vchandrasekaran/NFL-Analysis/blob/master/Images/NFL_2.png)The p value of X1 is greater than 0.05 and we will be removing it from our model.![NFL_3](https://github.com/vchandrasekaran/NFL-Analysis/blob/master/Images/NFL_3.png)The p value of X6 is greater than 0.05 and we will be removing it from our model.![NFL_4](https://github.com/vchandrasekaran/NFL-Analysis/blob/master/Images/NFL_4.png)At this point there are 4 regressors left and there is one more regressor with a slightly greater p value. We will eliminate that as well. ![NFL_5](https://github.com/vchandrasekaran/NFL-Analysis/blob/master/Images/NFL_5.png)In the end we come up with the final model with three independent variables. ![NFL_6](https://github.com/vchandrasekaran/NFL-Analysis/blob/master/Images/NFL_6.png)The variables that are selected are significant and the model has a good Adjusted R--squared value of 0.7596. Let us see if we can find any pattern in the model.![Test1](https://github.com/vchandrasekaran/NFL-Analysis/blob/master/Images/Fitted%20vs%20residual.png)The values obtained in the graph show that they are completely random. ![Anova](https://github.com/vchandrasekaran/NFL-Analysis/blob/master/Images/Anv.png)The Anova results show that the p values are significantly lesser than 0.05 we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there are different means. The confidence interval of the variables are calculated and we can conclude that the values would most likely fall in between them. ![CI](https://github.com/vchandrasekaran/NFL-Analysis/blob/master/Images/CI.png)We can now use our model to predict the number of games won by a team if we have the values of the regressors. Let us assume the following values are given for the data set. x1->2110x2->2127x3->38x4->59x5->1x6->789x7->58x8->2110x9->2127![newdata](https://github.com/vchandrasekaran/NFL-Analysis/blob/master/Images/newdata.png)Now let us perform a simple test just to understand the significance of the regressors in the model and a random elimination of any of the regressors. Removal of x2 from the model has an adverse effect on the model. The model given below is fitted without x2.![wx2](https://github.com/vchandrasekaran/NFL-Analysis/blob/master/Images/wx2.png)We can clearly see the significance of the regressors x7 and x8 has reduced by a huge margin. Also the R-squared and Adjusted R-squared has taken a huge hit. The model which is developed along with x2 is 78% accurate and the model which is developed without x2 is about 54% accurate. So x2 is an integral part of the model to predict the number of wins.
